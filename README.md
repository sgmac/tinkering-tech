# Tinkering tech

Trying to keep up with new technologies may be daunting, foremost you try new things and then you forget, you setup that awesome cluster, jotted some things down but you
do not ry anything else and finally forget. 

In this repository I will keep stuff I'm playing around with, probably notes and a setup scenario, 
this should be flawless and idempotent. If some indications do not work, please create a pull request. 
This idea is based on the [learning-tools](https://github.com/lowescott/learning-tools)  by Scott S. Lowe.
